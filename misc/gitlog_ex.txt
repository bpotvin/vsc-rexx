    Make OverlayClientComponentState strongly typed

    Summary:
    Right now the state for OverlayClientComponent is "any".  This isn't great.

    But we can't use a generic here as OverlaySystem needs to have a collection of OverlayClients and having a generic would break it (We would need one collection per generic type
).

    So I've kept the base class still using any.  But I've made the api that sets the state ("openOverlay") protected.  This way the derived classes have to expose their own public
 api to set the state, which then is strongly typed.

    Test Plan: Run unit tests in mocha/jest, run integration tests.

    Move rest of addressbar logic out of ContentNavUI

    Summary:
    I've added a component for the "addressbar" but there is still a bunch of logic in panel_app_nav_ui.ts that references it.

    I've moved all the logic that is part of the addressbar out of ContentNavUI and into AddressBar, and added unit test coverage for all of it.

    We may want to rename AddressBar to NavUIBar, but I'll do that in a future change (if we want to rename).

    [Carmel][WebUI] removed public use of setState and cleaned up unused imports

    Summary:
            - some componeents were calling setState on children, they now go through public methods
            - I didn't make state and setState protected yet because a ton of tests need to be updated
            - I tried turnning on linting for unused variables, but there was an issue with the UI namespace.  It gave me enough info to fix the issues, but I can't leave it on unt
il that's figured out.
            - I renamed to didUpdateChildren for consistency with other React events (like didRender).

    Test Plan: simulator

    Hit testing broken with address bar on top after deep link to video

    Summary:
    We have a problem that when the app gets background and then foreground our overlay state can get out of sync with chromium.  For example when you download an mp4, open it in c
inema and then go back to the browser, chromium thinks the overlay is still showing whereas the WebUI has hid it.

    The fix is to have chromium notify us when we are foreground so we can sync up state.

    Test Plan: Test in browser, ran unit tests.
