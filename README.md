From hence, ye beauties, undeceiv'd,<br>
Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd,<br>
And be with caution bold. <br>
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes <br>
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; <br>
Nor all, that glisters, gold.<br>
 - Thomas Grey

... Come, my friends, <br>
'T is not too late to seek a newer world. <br>
Push off, and sitting well in order smite <br>
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds <br>
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths <br>
Of all the western stars, until I die. <br>
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br> 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, <br>
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. <br>
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' <br>
We are not now that strength which in old days <br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; <br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts, <br> 
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will <br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. <br>
 - Alfred, Lord Tennyson
