From hence, ye beauties, undeceiv'd,<br>
Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd,<br>
And be with caution bold. <br>
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes <br>
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; <br>
Nor all, that glisters, gold.<br>

... Come, my friends,<br>
'T is not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br> 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'<br>
We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;<br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br> 
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.<br>
*[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]*

I'd rather be a could-be if I cannot be an are;<br>
Because a could-be is a maybe who is reaching for a star.<br>
I'd rather be a has-been than a might-have-been, by far;<br>
For a might-have-been has never been, but a has was once an are.<br>
*[Milton Berle]*
