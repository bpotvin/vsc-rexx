L'enfer, c'est les autres
 - Sartre

Kerle, wollt ihr ewig leben?
 - Frederick the Great, Battle of Kolín, 1757.

Nullius in verba
 - Horace

L’audace, l’audace, toujours l’audace.
 - G.S. Patton, Georges Danton

Primum non nocere
 - 

Le roi est mort, vive le roi!
 - 

From hence, ye beauties, undeceiv'd, 
Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd, 
And be with caution bold. 
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes 
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; 
Nor all, that glisters, gold.
 - Thomas Grey

... Come, my friends, 
'T is not too late to seek a newer world. 
Push off, and sitting well in order smite 
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
Of all the western stars, until I die. 
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' 
We are not now that strength which in old days 
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; 
One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will 
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
 - Alfred, Lord Tennyson
